    <title>Welcome to the Drupal Freelance group</title>

  <body>
    <p><em>Thanks for joining the Drupal Freelance Group!</em></p>

    <p>You should already be added automatically to a few channels on Slack.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Most new members start with introducing themselves in the #introductions channel. We would like to know a little bit about you!</li>
      <li>General discussions happen in the #general channel.</li>
      <li>If you would like to see available freelance Drupal jobs, then joining the #jobs channel would be a good idea.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I only ask that you do not use this as a source for recruiting freelancers for your employer or anyone else. This is the only strict rule. Fine if you are looking for another freelancer to share your own freelance work with though :)</p>

    <p><strong>The Drupal Freelance group is an inclusive community. We welcome all people from all backgrounds and all levels of experience.</strong></p>

    <p>Feel free also to review the <a href="https://medium.com/@farez/drupal-freelancer-community-join-us-ffb99967a359" target="_blank">mission of this group</a> and <a href="https://farez2.typeform.com/to/PObooe" target="_blank">invite your Drupal developer contacts to this group</a>. The more people join, the more useful this community will be.</p>

    <p>Looking forward to having you as an active member of the community!</p>
